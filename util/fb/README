These are some things that will work on the linux framebuffer device.  fbtest
only draws some colors to prove that it works, fhashira is a game that you can
actually play:

$ fhashira [blocksize] [left] 2> /dev/null # assuming bash for redirection

redirecting stderr is not a must, but hardly recommended, blocksize tells how
many pixels a block shall be wide and left tells how many pixels from the left
edge of the screen you want to start fhashira to display it's board.
